# Hopfield-network-exams
This repository shows 3 different notebooks that are the solutions created for the exams on the "Theoretical Models of Memory" course by Mikhail Katkov.

# Project
This was a group project done while following the Big Data Master's at Novosibirsk State University (RU)

# Technology
We represented how human memory works using the Hopfield network 

# Exercices
* Assuming sparse Hopfield network, plot dependency of memory capacity on sparsity parameter. Assume that memory is recovered, if overlap is 90%. Compare it with Hopfield network capacity.
* In recall model plot the dependency of the number of recalled words on the number of presented words for 2 sparsity levels  and  compare curves with theoretical prediction. 
* In forgetting model with n = 5, consider 2 experimental protocols consisting of 2 trials. In both protocols in first trial find all the words that are remembered out of 500 presented. For second trial move words that are remembered in front of list.  In first protocol, present words in modified order, whereas in second protocol present words in reverse order from the end of list to beginning. Compare the number of words remembered in 2 protocols.
